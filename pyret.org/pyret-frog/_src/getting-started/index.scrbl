@title{Getting Started}

@section{Disclaimer}

@bold{A word of warning:} Pyret is available to run, but doesn't
yet have the stability or tool support of a true release.  We've
used it in two of our undergraduate courses at Brown, and that's
taught us a lot about what the language needs going forward.
These instructions are here for intrepid early adopters to give us
feedback.  If you'd like to hear about stable releases of Pyret in
the future, sign up for
@link["https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyret-announce"
"the announcements mailing list"].

@section{Installing}

Pyret runs on top of Racket, so you'll first need to install
Racket from:

@url{http://download.racket-lang.org/}

Then, choose how you'd like to proceed:

@seclink["s:ide"]{
I want an IDE and a REPL and click-to-install.
}

@seclink["s:cli"]{
I want to use my favorite editor and the command line.
}

@subsection[#:tag "s:ide"]{Getting Started with an IDE}

Open DrRacket, which comes with the Racket installation.  It has an icon that
looks like this:

@image["img/plt-logo-red-shiny.png"]

Then, use File -> Install .plt File, select the Web tab, copy paste the URL
below into the space, and click "OK"

@url{http://pyret.org/download/pyret-0.1.plt}

@image["img/install-via-url.png"]

Once this process has completed, you can run Pyret programs in DrRacket.

To run a Pyret program, change the top line to say @tt{#lang
pyret/check}, and write your program below it.  For example, you might
put this into the definitions window and run it:

@pre[
"#lang pyret/check

fun square(n):
  n * n
where:
  square(2) is 4
  square(4) is 16
  square(8) is 64
end"
]

Run this with "Ctrl-R" or by pressing the green arrow "Run" button.  You should
see, in the interactions window, a success message like

@pre[
"Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!"
]

Once you've gotten this far, move on to the
@link["/tour/" "tour of Pyret's features"].

@subsection[#:tag "s:cli"]{Getting Started at the Command Line}

First, make sure that the Racket binaries are in your path.  Then, check
out the @link["http://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang" "Pyret repo"]:

@pre[
"$ git clone https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang.git"
]

Then, run two commands to build Pyret:

@pre[
"$ make dep
$ make"
]

Now, you can open any editor and write a Pyret program by starting it
with @tt{#lang pyret/check} as the first line.  For example, copy this
into your favorite editor, and save it in a file called “square.arr”:

@pre[
"#lang pyret/check

fun square(n):
  n * n
where:
  square(2) is 4
  square(4) is 16
  square(8) is 64
end"
]

Then, from the command line, run:

@pre[
"$ raco pyret square.arr
Looks shipshape, all 3 tests passed, mate!"
]

Pyret currently supports a few
@link["/docs/s_running.html#%28part._s~3aeditors%29" "editor modes"],
more will be added as time goes on.

Once you see this program working, move on to the
@link["/tour/" "tour of Pyret's features"].
